## DCF Valuation Model with Monte Carlo Sensitivity

This project implements the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model — a core tool in corporate finance — to estimate a company's intrinsic equity value.  
The model is enhanced with **Monte Carlo simulation** for robust sensitivity analysis.

The project features a minimalist, interactive **web application built with Streamlit**, allowing users to adjust all financial and risk inputs in real time.

### Advanced Features

- **Interactive Web Interface (Streamlit):**  
  Simplifies input and provides immediate visualization of results.

- **Two-Stage Growth Model:**  
  FCF projection uses distinct growth rates, reflecting an initial high-growth period followed by maturation.

- **Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis:**  
  Quantifies risk and uncertainty in key valuation parameters (WACC and long-term growth *g*), yielding a range of fair values rather than a single deterministic price.

- **Risk Indicator:**  
  A color-coded indicator displays the overall risk (Standard Deviation / Mean) of the Monte Carlo simulation.

- **Visualization:**  
  Generates a histogram using Matplotlib to display the distribution of simulated share values.

### Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `dcf_model.py` | Contains the core valuation logic: FCF projection, Terminal Value calculation, and the Monte Carlo engine. This file handles the math. |
| `dcf_app_minimal.py` | Main entry point for the web application. Handles all user input (sidebar sliders) and result presentation via Streamlit. |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists Python library dependencies, including Streamlit, NumPy, and Matplotlib. |
| `README.md` | This document. |

### Project Setup

**1) Clone the Repository**

git clone [Your Repository URL]  
cd Company-Valuation-DCF

**2) Install Dependencies**

Install required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

**3) Execution (Web Application)**

Run the interactive Streamlit application using the following command:

streamlit run dcf_app_minimal.py

This command will launch the application in your default web browser.  
When executed, the app will automatically generate the `monte_carlo_distribution.png` file in the root directory for use in this documentation.

### Key Output: Monte Carlo Risk Profile

The **Monte Carlo simulation** is the core of the risk analysis.  
This output illustrates the probability distribution of the **Implied Value Per Share** based on the input uncertainties.

### Key Model Inputs (Base Case)

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial FCF (Year 0)** | $150,000,000 | Base for FCF projections. |
| **Net Debt** | $20,000,000 | Subtracted to find Equity Value. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 25,000,000 | Used for Per Share calculation. |
| **WACC (Mean Discount Rate)** | 10.00% | Primary discounting factor. |
| **Initial Growth (Stage 1)** | 20.0% | High growth rate for early expansion phase. |
| **Perpetuity Growth ('g' Mean)** | 2.50% | Long-term growth assumption. |



This detailed analysis justifies the simulated output by linking key financial inputs to the visual evidence presented in the Monte Carlo histogram. The high initial valuation is primarily driven by the **aggressive two-stage growth assumption** (starting at 20.0%) over a 5-year period, resulting in a robust mean valuation of **$129.00** per share. The Cost of Capital (10.00%) is the critical factor, as minor fluctuations in this rate, combined with the volatility in the perpetuity growth ('g'), create the final spread of values. 

**Interpretation of the Value Distribution:**
The histogram confirms a **significant** dispersion around the mean (Std. Dev.: $20.68). The spread defined by the 95% Confidence Interval (from $97.65 to $178.48) is wide, demonstrating that the valuation is highly sensitive to input volatility. The mean ($129.00) is slightly higher than the median ($126.00), confirming a slight positive skew (a longer tail towards higher values). This is common in finance, reflecting greater potential for upside surprises. This dispersion visually represents the risk inherent in relying on long-term growth forecasts.
