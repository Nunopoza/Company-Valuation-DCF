## DCF Valuation Model with Monte Carlo Sensitivity

This project implements the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model — a core tool in corporate finance — to estimate a company's intrinsic equity value.  
The model is enhanced with **Monte Carlo simulation** for robust sensitivity analysis.

The project features a minimalist, interactive **web application built with Streamlit**, allowing users to adjust all financial and risk inputs in real time.

### Advanced Features

- **Interactive Web Interface (Streamlit):**  
  Simplifies input and provides immediate visualization of results.

- **Two-Stage Growth Model:**  
  FCF projection uses distinct growth rates, reflecting an initial high-growth period followed by maturation.

- **Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis:**  
  Quantifies risk and uncertainty in key valuation parameters (WACC and long-term growth *g*), yielding a range of fair values rather than a single deterministic price.

- **Risk Indicator:**  
  A color-coded indicator displays the overall risk (Standard Deviation / Mean) of the Monte Carlo simulation.

- **Visualization:**  
  Generates a histogram using Matplotlib to display the distribution of simulated share values.

### Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `dcf_model.py` | Contains the core valuation logic: FCF projection, Terminal Value calculation, and the Monte Carlo engine. This file handles the math. |
| `dcf_app_minimal.py` | Main entry point for the web application. Handles all user input (sidebar sliders) and result presentation via Streamlit. |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists Python library dependencies, including Streamlit, NumPy, and Matplotlib. |
| `README.md` | This document. |

### Project Setup

**1) Clone the Repository**

git clone [Your Repository URL]  
cd Company-Valuation-DCF

**2) Install Dependencies**

Install required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

**3) Execution (Web Application)**

Run the interactive Streamlit application using the following command:

streamlit run dcf_app_minimal.py

This command will launch the application in your default web browser.  
When executed, the app will automatically generate the `monte_carlo_distribution.png` file in the root directory for use in this documentation.

### Key Output: Monte Carlo Risk Profile

The **Monte Carlo simulation** is the core of the risk analysis.  
This output illustrates the probability distribution of the **Implied Value Per Share** based on the input uncertainties.

#### 1. Value Distribution Plot
Below is the histogram generated by the model, displaying the simulated fair value range.

#### 2. Quantitative Analysis
This analysis interprets the simulated results, focusing on **risk and valuation uncertainty**.

The simulation results show an **expected intrinsic value (mean)** of **$124.59**, which represents the most probable outcome.  
However, the **standard deviation** of **$26.58** confirms the **Moderate Risk (Fair)** assessment, indicating meaningful volatility in the valuation.

The **95% Confidence Range**, spanning from **$87.59 to $187.46**, demonstrates the broad impact that small changes in **WACC** and **perpetuity growth ('g')** assumptions can have on the final price.  
This range helps investors **quantify the true uncertainty** inherent in the DCF model.
